# Fish in the maze(filnal project)
This is my final project of embedded programming class. It is a combination of option 1(escaping maze) and option 3(leader and follower).

## Project gaol
A small fish call bony is trying to get out of th maze. Bony is made by a blue head(leader) and red body(follower) following a tail(follower). Each of the followers is following by a different distance, so his body won't sqeeze all together. A maze is constructed by static objects, with a yellow goal that can free bony when he touches it. Bony will get stuck in some places sometimes, but don't worry, he will teleport himself to a new place after a few seconds.
